# Introduction

Vancouver is one of the Top 10 cities to live in around the world, according to The Economist Intelligence Unitâ€™s 2019 Global Liveability Index. One of my friends would like to move there and open a gym there, but is unsure of where he should open it. He has learned that I am doing a Data Science Certificate program, and is wondering if I could help him do some analysis and see which location in Vancouver may be the best. He wants to make sure there are not too many other gyms/indoor sports facilities located closeby already.

# Data

I downloaded the Vancouver neighborhood data from the Wikipedia site (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_V)
