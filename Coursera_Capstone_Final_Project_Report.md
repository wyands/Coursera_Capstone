# Introduction

Vancouver is one of the Top 10 cities to live in around the world, according to The Economist Intelligence Unitâ€™s 2019 Global Liveability Index. One of my friends would like to move there and open a gym there, but is unsure of where he should open it. He has learned that I am doing a Data Science Certificate program, and is wondering if I could help him do some analysis and see which location in Vancouver may be the best. He wants to make sure there are not too many other gyms/indoor sports facilities located closeby already.

# Data

I downloaded the Vancouver neighborhood data from the [Wikipedia site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_postal_codes_of_Canada:_V). This website contains the list of postal codes in British Columbia, Canada, with the borough and neighborhood(s) data under each postal code. I also downloaded the latitude and longitude coordinates for each postal code using the CA.zip file under the [GeoNames.org website](http://download.geonames.org/export/zip/). I scraped the data and combined these together to get the Borough, Neighborhood, Latitude and Longitude data by Postal Code. Since this data contains postal codes/boroughs that are in the British Columbia province, I further narrowed it to only include postal codes that are in the Vancouver Borough. This forms the basis for the neighborhood data
