# Introduction

Vancouver is one of the Top 10 cities to live in around the world, according to The Economist Intelligence Unitâ€™s 2019 Global Liveability Index. One of my friends would like to move there and open a gym there, but is unsure of where he should open it. He has learned that I am doing a Data Science Certificate program, and is wondering if I could help him do some analysis and see which location in Vancouver may be the best. He wants to make sure there are not too many other gyms/indoor sports facilities located close by already.

The target audience of this problem is my friend, who is looking to invest in opening a gym. He cares about this problem because if he picks a location that has too many other gyms already, he may not get enough customers for him gym, and may end up losing his money investing in the gym.
